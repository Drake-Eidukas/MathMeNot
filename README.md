# MathMeNot
Alexa game skill for simple math problems!

This is the #1 project in my year of code challenge! This simple alexa skill will do the following: 
- Get user input on difficulty of problems ranging from idiot to einstein
- Generate a quiz of math problems ranging from simple addition to solving systems of equations.
- Present the quiz question by question, allowing users to ask the alexa to repeat the current question, but once you answer, you cannot go back. 
- Present the user with their score at the end. 

All in all not a terribly complicated skill, but it's the first of many.
