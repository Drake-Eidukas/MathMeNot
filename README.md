# MathMeNot
Alexa game skill for simple math problems!

This is the #1 project in my year of code challenge! This simple alexa skill will do the following: 
1. Get user input on difficulty of problems ranging from idiot to einstein
2. Generate a quiz of math problems ranging from simple addition to solving systems of equations.
3. Present the quiz question by question, allowing users to ask the alexa to repeat the current question, but once you answer, you cannot go back. 
4. Present the user with their score at the end. 

All in all not a terribly complicated skill, but it's the first of many.
